Our Project allow users to search for hawker centre, and view detailed information about each stall, including their menu items. Users can also check the queue length at each stall to decide whether to queue in person or pre-order their food for collection. 
The app also provides direction and distance to the hawker centres based on the user location and show routing using google map(external). In Overall, this makes finding hawker centre more convenient, efficient, and enjoyable for all users
